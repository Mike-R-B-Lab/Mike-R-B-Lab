## Hi there <img src="https://github.com/nixin72/nixin72/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm Michael Laberge

A Data & Machine Learning Enthusiast, Mechanical Engineering Graduate and AWS Certificate holder.

My passion for data and coding was sparked during an introductory coding class at university and expanded during my time working with data at Coca-Cola. I taught myself to code in my spare time and pursued a career shift after realizing mechanical engineering wasn't for me.

To further refine my data skills, I completed a 12-week intensive course at MIT, diving deep into data science and machine learning algorithms.

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- [Loan Classification Model (Unsupervised & Supervised Learning)](https://github.com/Mike-R-B-Lab/Loan_Classification_Model)
- [Sales Forecast Regression Model (Supervised Learning)](https://github.com/Mike-R-B-Lab/Sales_Forecast)
- [Stock Portfolio Optimization (Network Analysis)](https://github.com/Mike-R-B-Lab/Stock_Portfolio_Optimization)
- [NYC Shootings (Power BI)](https://github.com/Mike-R-B-Lab/NYC_Shootings)

About me, I love traveling and being outside. Just recently came back from 6 weeks in London (not the best place to be outisde). I'm also big on health and sports. Played rugby and basketball in my hayday and now focused on staying fit.

I'm excited to continue growing in the fields of data science, machine learning, and cloud computing.
